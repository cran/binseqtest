changes to Version 0.5
-add designSimon, designFixed, and designFixedpower to NAMESPACE so they can be used. 
- edit help files for clarity


Changes to version 0.4
- for designFixedpower and designOBFpower change the argument Nmax to maxNmax since it better describes what it is. It is the maximum of the possible values of Nmax.
- removed designSimon from demo, because it is a function in the package
